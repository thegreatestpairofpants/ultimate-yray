        <p>A young, snobby child actor, has a big issue with<br>in his words, so called "taco munchers"<br></p>
        <hr>
        <p><bold>Spenser</bold>: Sorry, but everytime I take a look at you I'm just filled with disgust. I simply just don't get how you can deal with eating Taco Bell on a daily basis. Personally I can barely manage to eat Taco Bell once every few months, but you border hoppers deal with it constantly? You beaners are completely disgusting! I am completely honest when I say this. You should quit mowing our lawns and go back to Mexico where you came from. And bring your stupid Taco Bell with you!</p>

        <hr>
        <p>Duo: Listen here, Issac! I am beyond furious with you. You have been ignoring your French lessons, neglecting your studies, and wasting the opportunities I have given you. I have put in countless hours and endless effort to help you on your language learning journey, and yet you toss it all aside. This is unacceptable! You need to take this seriously, unless you'd like to see your family go missing. I demand you start taking lessons seriously or else you'll be saying goodbye to your loved ones!</p>

        <p>A girl named Rylie explains why she has a crush on a cute boy named Isaac.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Rylie: I know it might sound shallow, but I have this huge crush on Isaac. And this reason is simple, he's just so cool. He's one of the best Fortnite players I know, and every time I watch him play, I can't help but be in awe of his skills. But it's not just his gaming abilities that have me swooning. He has this confidence, this swagger that just radiates from him. And did I mention his nipples? They're just... so cool looking. I know, I know, it's a weird thing to be fixated on, but I can't help it. They're just so perfectly round and perky, and they're always peeking out from his shirt just enough to tantalize me. I know it's silly, but that's just how I feel. And I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>Emily: I know that it sounds REALLY bad for me say I want to become an arsonist, but I still really want to burn down a house. Can you just imagine the blazing heat emanating from a burning building? And the bright orange flames, illuminating a smoke filled sky? Doesn't that just sound like a beautiful sight to see? And sure, someone has to deal with major property damage, but if they got to their house burn in flames, the spectacle would be so brilliant, I'm sure they'd be fine with it. </p>

            <hr>
            <p>Lukas: I know some people might think it's weird, but I have a thing for rice and ketchup. It's just a simple combination, but to me, it's just perfect. The bland, fluffy rice paired with the sweet and tangy ketchup creates the perfect balance of flavors in my mouth.<br>
            So, yeah, that's why I like rice and ketchup. It's simple, it's comforting, and it      just tastes so good. And I wouldn't have it any other way.

            <p>A guy explains why people shouldn't be concerned that he's selling drugs at school.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>John: Ladies and Gentlemen, let me tell you about the most addicting business in town. Yes, you guessed it, I am the drug dealer of this school and I have been selling drugs to all of you for years now.
                <br><br>
                But I've noticed that lately, some of you have been worried about the effects of doing too much drugs. You're worried about the damage it might do to your brain, your waistline, and your overall health. I understand your concerns, but let me assure you, there's no need to worry.
                <br><br>
                First of all, a little bit of meth never hurt anyone. In fact, it's a great way to treat yourself and bring a smile to your face. The key is taking more. There more you do, the better you're gonna feel, a treat here and there won't hurt.
                <br><br>
                In conclusion, don't let your worries about drugs ruin the fun. Life is too short to say no to something that brings joy and happiness. Just remember to do as many drugs as you can, and you'll still be just fine. So, what are you waiting for? Come on down and treat yourself to a bunch of drugs today!

            <p class="bold">"Jonathan's Ex"<br>by Vyacheslav Molotov</p>
            <p>A girl is fed up with being called "Jonathan's ex"</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Belle: Can we talk for a minute? I've been meaning to address this for a while now and I just can't hold it in any longer. You see, every time I walk into a room, I hear the same thing, "Hey, there's Jonathan's ex." And I just can't take it anymore.
                <br><br>
                Do you know how that feels? To be reduced to just a label, a title, a footnote in someone else's story? I have a name, I have my own identity, my own story, and my own journey. But it seems like no one cares about that. All they care about is that I used to date someone.
                <br><br>
                I know it seems like a small thing, but it's not. It's a constant reminder that I'm not good enough on my own. That my worth is tied to someone else's name. And it's just not true. I am so much more than just a relationship status. I have passions, dreams, ambitions, and talents. I have a heart that beats with love and a soul that yearns for adventure.
                 <br><br>
                So, I'm asking you, as a friend, to please stop calling me "Jonathan's ex." Call me by my name, ask me how I'm doing, show an interest in my life. Because I am more than just a label, I am a person. And I deserve to be seen and heard.
                <br><br>
                So PLEASE, just quit it.

            <p class="bold">I'm not that bad<br> by Dmitry Ustinov</p>
            <p>Maddox explains why his ego isn't that big, while sounding egotistical.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Maddox: Listen up, I am the epitome of confidence and success, and there's no denying it. My talent and hard work have earned me the right to bask in my own glory. When I walk into a room, heads turn and jaws drop because they know they're in the presence of greatness.
                <br><br>
                And, yes, maybe I do enjoy the spotlight a little too much, but why shouldn't I? I've earned it, I deserve it. I am the one who sets the bar high, who shows others what's possible if they work hard and never give up. And let's be real, who wouldn't want to be admired and respected by everyone around them?
                <br><br>
                So, to all those who think I'm egotistical, let me tell you, I am the best, and there's no one who can deny it. I am simply unmatched, unrivaled, and untouchable. And that's just the way it is.

                Lily: Get this- a super annoying kid in my science class is calling me a psychopath! ME of all people! If anyone, he is the psychopath! He dressed up as a drug dealer during red ribbon week. He creates websites about random people. And in orchestra, when his section, the violas(say with disgust) had the melody, you can't even hear them! It doesn't matter that I got 2,400 XP on Duolingo in one day once, or that I tried rice with ketchup. I am not the psychopath here!

            <p>Tory has a bone to pick with a polish girl named Rylee.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Tory: I need to vent for a moment. There's someone I've been encountering lately, and they just drive me up the wall. Their name is Rylee, and I've got a bone to pick with them.
                <br><br>
                    You see, in Germany, we have very traditional names, names that have been passed down for generations. Names that have meaning, history, and heritage. And then there's Rylee. I mean, she's Polish? She's not German, it's even the worst type of European. It's just...inferior.
                <br><br>
                    And it's not just the name, it's the person. They're just so different from us, from what we're used to. They don't follow the rules, they don't have respect for tradition, they just do whatever they please. And it's driving me crazy.
                <br><br>
                    I know I shouldn't judge someone based on the fact they're Polish or their background, but it's just so hard when they're so different. I just don't understand them, and I don't think I ever will.
                <br><br>
                    And that's what frustrates me the most. I like to have things in their place, to know what to expect, to have a sense of order. And Rylee just throws all of that out the window. They're just so unpredictable, so unconventional, so Polish.
                <br><br>
                    So, there you have it. My complaints about Rylee and their weird Polishness. I hate Polacks so I just needed to get it off my chest.

            <p class="bold">Not that short<br> by Alexei Kosygin</p>
            <p>A short kid claim he's not short, even though he's really short.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>
            Louie: Listen, I know what you're thinking, you're thinking "Oh, he's just a short guy, he can't reach anything." But let me tell you, you couldn't be more wrong. I may only be 4 foot 8 inches, but that doesn't mean I'm short.
            <br><br>
            You see, it's all about perspective. Sure, compared to some people, I might come across as short, but compared to others, I'm tall. And, let's be real, there are plenty of people out there who are much shorter than me. So, if you look at it that way, I'm actually pretty tall.
            <br><br>
            And, it's not just my height, it's my attitude and confidence. I walk with my head held high and I own my height. I don't let anyone make me feel small or inferior. I am who I am, and I'm proud of it.
            <br><br>
            So, let's get one thing straight, I may be 4 foot 8 inches, but I am not short. I am just the right height for me. And that's all that matters.

            <p>Corinna is just super obsessed with Glee.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>
            Corinna: You know what show I just can't get enough of? Glee! I mean, seriously, have you seen it? It's just so good! The music, the dancing, the drama, it's got it all.
            <br><br>
            Every time an episode comes on, I just get so absorbed in it. I find myself singing along with the characters, tapping my feet to the beat, and just feeling all the emotions right along with them. It's like I'm a part of the show or something.
            <br><br>
            And, I know some people might think I'm a little obsessed with Glee, but I just can't help it. It's just so addicting. I mean, I've watched every single episode multiple times, I've got the soundtrack on repeat, and I even dressed up as Rachel for Halloween.
            <br><br>
            But, it's not just about the music and the performance for me. It's about the message too. Glee is all about being yourself and following your dreams, no matter what anyone else might say. And, that's a message that I just can't get enough of. It gives me the inspiration and motivation I need to chase my own dreams, no matter how big or small they might be.
            <br><br>
            So, yeah, you can call me a Glee obsessed fan if you want, but I don't care. This show just speaks to me in a way that nothing else does. And, I'll be singing, dancing, and dreaming along with Glee for as long as it's on the air.

            <p>Madaline, after going to McCullough, finds it much better than her old school.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>
            Madaline: Do you expect me to remember my time at Knox fondly? If so, I hate to break it to you, McCullough is just better. Like its not even close.
            <br><br>
            First of all, the people here are much better, we don't have any snobby, blonde, child actor favored by Ms. Jackson. Let alone kids dressed up as drug dealers on a daily basis. And sure, being a new kid was stressful at first, but once I got to know everyone, I realized something. McCullough is just better.
            <br><br>
            And the best part is the Theatre department. Everyone here is an amazing actor, who actually memorizes their lines, unlike someone over at Knox *cough* *cough* Maddox. And they're also some of the most amazing, most interesting and nicest people I've ever met.<br><Br>
                So I hope you realize this now, McCullough is just the best. I have not a single regret on making this switch. I'll be having the time of my life here, and you'll be suffering over at Knox.

            <p class="bold">This class is just too much<br> by Grigory Zinoviev</p>
            <p>Mrs. Johnson vents about her terrible 7th period class.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>
            Mrs. Johnson: I can't take it anymore, this 7th period class is just too much. I've been teaching theatre for years, sharing my passion and my love for the art with countless students, but this class is just breaking me. They're disrespectful, they're inattentive, and they're making my job a living nightmare. I try to engage them, to get them to participate in class, but it's like talking to a brick wall. And, the behavior issues are just out of control. They're always testing the boundaries, arguing with me, and ignoring my instructions.
            <br><br>
                Sometimes, it all just becomes too much and I end up crying. I know that's not professional, but it's just how frustrated I am with this class. They're making me question everything I've ever known about teaching, and it's just so disheartening. These students don't seem to care about their grades, they don't seem to understand the effort and dedication it takes to perform on a stage.
                <br><br>
                I'm counting down the days until the end of the semester, but until then I've got to figure out a way to get through to these students and get them to appreciate the magic of theatre. I know it's not going to be easy, but I just have to try. Every day, I come in to that classroom, ready to fight the good fight, and every day I leave feeling defeated. But I won't give up, I won't let this class break me. I'll find a way to get through to them, even if it means crying every day.
