    <h1>Isaac St. Michel in Africa: Monkey Converting Time!</h1>
    <h3>The hit new game staring Isaac St. Michel</h3>
    <p id="weird">"Never have I experienced so much fun converting monkeys as Isaac" -You if you read this out loud</p>

    <p><i>"This game is an amazing way to interpret the concept of converting monkeys. Not only monkeys, but anyone or thing in general. My children have played it as well and are obsessed! It‚Äôs gotten so bad to the point where they are addicted to playing the game. This game is also designed very well, and I think it is underrated! The graphics and content are very child-friendly and it‚Äôs very easy to understand the message hidden in the game. I mentioned how my children love it, but I do too! Even my two dogs enjoy playing it. I‚Äôm SO great full that this game was created because it allows me to put my problems at ease. My anxiety practically disappears and my kids go quiet and focus when playing it. I believe it‚Äôs also great to help improve concentration skills." -Ariana</i></p>

    <p><i>"I give it 6/5 stars" -Lily</i></p>

    <p><i>"The concept of this game is a bit difficult to understand , but that‚Äôs just me because i‚Äôm a little stupid. My dad introduced me to the game and It‚Äôs SOO much better than fortnite! But roblox is still 10000x better. I‚Äôve unlocked ALL of the endings and I like the choices! My dad found a new addiction and it‚Äôs the game. Ever since he‚Äôs played it, he has been nicer and stopped punishing us for nothing. He even treats my mom better!! He doesn‚Äôt dance on her grave anymore and puts a daisy when we visit her now. This game really helped me under the importance of converting people or things.. I‚Äôm thankful!" -Ariana</i></p>

    <p><i>"Never have so had so much fun converting monkeys as Isaac" -Jack</i></p>

    <p><i>"The Isaac game has changed my life completely and forever. The multiple choices throughout the game makes me feel like I have power in life. As a woman Ik I have rights being taken away from me. For a fact woman are often discriminated against and dehumanized. This game can reinforce meaning and purpose in a woman‚Äôs life that is so short lived in the first place. From committing felonies to converting monkeys this is one of the most thoughtful and entertaining video games in existence. Not only am I a woman but I‚Äôm also part German, so it warms my heart knowing others enjoy the passion and hobby of taking monkeys and putting them in their place. JJ is my dear friend, ally , and idol. I thank him and the Meir sheer strength of this game alone for fulfilling my purpose in life." -Torrey</i></p>

    <p><i>"In the good old days, we didn‚Äôt have technology. I rarely ever post on my Facebook page! The most I use my phone for is to call my wife. Texting is for the newer generations. Riding horses is for folks like us. I don‚Äôt even check the time on my phone. Lookin‚Äô at a clock is the correct way to do it. Any true man has a watch on them. However, when my local pastor introduced this game I was amused. I talked to my mawmaw who‚Äôs up in heaven or he double hocked sticks ( I don‚Äôt know) and she told me it was the right thing to do. I know she meant to play, and now I play it everyday and night. ‚ÄúIsaac St. Michel in Africa: Monkey Converting Time!‚Äù Also reminds me of the good old days. I feel like a kiddo again when I play it and it puts a lil life back into me. Credits to the creators for creating a game good enough to my likings!üòä" -Ariana</i></p>

    <p><i>"i luv de game bc my papa luvs it!! My papa left me and mama becaus e he has work to work on!! He said he was gonna bring home some milk but he has nt cume bac yet.. he told me to pway it and i dunno wha da poit is but i luv it alotta! I so happy it was creat e d!!"-Arainna</i></p>

    <p><i>"I‚Äôm an good old folk. My grand children played it and told me I was in the game. I didn‚Äôt see myself anywhere until they pointed at the monkeys and I think they got confused. Probably that whole ‚Äúevolution thing‚Äù they were talking about. If i‚Äôm a monkey everyone is! I relate to the game really well because it reminds me of the good old days. Me and my fam were held hostage as slaves, and my mama helped me escape. I dunno what happened to her but I continued the family like she told me to! I love her a lot and she appeared in my dream and told me I should play the game to because I can relate to it and that she‚Äôs actually in it. I haven‚Äôt seen her yet, but maybe I will soon." -Ariana</i></p>
